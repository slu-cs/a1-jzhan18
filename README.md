Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - I can't find deadlines for registration and absentee voting in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Arguably the contact information is not for navigation and thus shouldn't be a <nav>.
    - The Absentee Voting page is sort of outside the navigation structure.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - In the Contact Us sidebar, text alignment is uneven.
    - On the Absentee Voting page, the lists need more left margin.
    - The Registration page has a different color scheme than all the others (and makes the link hard to see).
